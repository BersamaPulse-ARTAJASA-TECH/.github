# BersamaPulse 💚 

Welcome to BersamaPulse, an innovative application designed to provide personalized care recommendations for heart health recovery. 
This repository is part of our entry for BPJS Kesehatan Healthkathon 2024 and contains the essential components for our project.

Currently, BersamaPulse includes a basic machine learning model and a simple mobile application as an initial demonstration of our idea. 
In future versions, we plan to expand the project to include a full-featured backend, API integration, and real-time health data collection. 
This will enable a more comprehensive system for personalized health recommendations, incorporating advanced data analytics and secure data management.

## About the Project
Currently, BersamaPulse focuses on providing personalized activity recommendations for heart health recovery. However, our vision extends beyond 
this initial phase. We aim to develop BersamaPulse into a comprehensive virtual health assistant that not only suggests daily activities but also offers dietary guidance, 
medication reminders, and real-time support. In critical situations, BersamaPulse will assist users experiencing heart attacks by contacting nearby hospitals for ambulance 
dispatch and notifying family members. Through these future capabilities, we hope to make BersamaPulse an essential companion, supporting users both in daily recovery and during emergencies.
